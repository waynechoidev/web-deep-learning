# Web-based Machine Learning Training

### Simulation of Linear Regression and Custom MLP Models using TypeScript

Dive into a web-based machine learning training that explores both linear regression and custom Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) models. This project presents manual implementations through TypeScript, visualized with Chart.js. By avoiding established machine learning libraries, it highlights a self-built approach. The project utilizes [the Boston Housing Dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~delve/data/boston/bostonDetail.html) for practical application.
